# Getting Started with Modern Web Development

Web development has evolved significantly over the years. If you're just starting out, the landscape might seem overwhelming. This guide will help you navigate the essential technologies and create a clear learning path.

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Before diving into frameworks and libraries, it's crucial to master the fundamentals:

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML provides the structure of web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of your website.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS handles the visual presentation. It's what makes your website look good.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    line-height: 1.6;
    color: #333;
}

h1 {
    color: #0066cc;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

### JavaScript

JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to your websites.

```javascript
// Simple example
const button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', () => {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

## Modern Development Tools

1. **Code Editor**: VS Code, Sublime Text, or Atom
